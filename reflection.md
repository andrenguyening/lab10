# Streamlit vs Flask

## How does Streamlit differ from Flask?

Streamlit is a high-level Python library primarily used for creating interactive data science web applications. It simplifies the process of building web apps by allowing developers to focus on data and visualizations, handling most of the underlying web development complexities. In contrast, Flask is a lightweight web framework that provides more flexibility and control over the web application development process. It's suitable for building a wide range of web applications beyond data science-focused projects.

## When would you use Flask instead of Streamlit?

You would use Flask when you need more control over the structure and functionality of your web application, especially if you're building a complex web application that requires custom routing, authentication, or integration with other libraries and frameworks. Flask is a better choice for building general-purpose web applications that go beyond data science or visualization-focused projects.
